# My desktop dotfiles

My current dotfiles consist of a number of different programs. I use stow to store all the files in one folder and
manage the symlinks into my ~/$HOME folder

heres a link to a site explaining how to use [stow for dotfiles] (http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html).

In case that Syntax theme has a dark background color, it only uses its hue, but otherwise stays light. This lets you use light-dark combos.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom/one-light-ui/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom/one-light-ui","_id":"one-light-ui@0.4.0","_shasum":"6a8c5bed66425cecd943a2d59d1b9669d65ceb48","_resolved":"file:../../../../../d-115215-25606-1dtystg/package.tgz","_from":"../../../../../d-115215-25606-1dtystg/package.tgz"}
